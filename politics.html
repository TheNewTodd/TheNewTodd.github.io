Politics are a very debatable thing especially right now with out new president Donald Trump. Though many people think all he is unfit to act as the president he really is going to become an effective president. He has already planned on how to pay off the foreign debt with the chinese. 
 Many people who say that they do not like Donald Trump is either becuase they dont actually know what he is doing or they just wanted a woman president instead of Trump.</p>
